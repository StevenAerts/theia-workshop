# Exercise 1: Implement JSON-Form Widget Open Handler

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/StevenAerts/theia-workshop/tree/exercise-1)

Your first exercise is to implement for which file the JSON-Form widget should be opened, and when it should be used as a primary widget.
Right now, it can be opened for any file, and an editor widget has a priority over it.

Change [JsonschemaFormOpenHandler](jsonschema-form-extension/src/browser/jsonschema-form-open-handler.ts) in a way that:

- only JSON files can be opened;
- if a file name ends with `-data` (e.g.  `simple-data.json`) then the double-click on a file should open the JSON-form widget instead of the editor widget;
- otherwise, the editor widget should be opened.

## The solution

When you finish, compare your solution with the [suggested](https://github.com/TypeFox/theia-workshop/blob/d32124df4b77c236c0e6b1da71cd5243b53aa0dd/jsonschema-form-extension/src/browser/jsonschema-form-open-handler.ts#L16-L24).
